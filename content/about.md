Hi, I'm Aaina Aroda! Welcome to my personal website! I am currently a sophomore attending the University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign. In fact, this website is for my midterm project for my STAT 385 course at UIUCCCCC.

I am originally from Singapore but live in Palatine, IL now. I grew up playing soccer and tennis and those are sports that I still play frequently and heavily follow them. My favorite soccer team is Manchester United and my favorite tennis player is Roger Federer. At college, I am a pursuing a BS in Econometrics with a minor in Computer Science. Over the upcming summer, I am doing supply chain analysis for Ingredion, a comapny based in Westchester, IL. In the future, I hope to learn more about data science and different programming languages, so I can hopefully become a data analyst upon graduation.
